"""Voices on a channel: who said each segment, and how a voice is shown (decision 0026).

A speaker id is ``<channel>:<n>``, numbered by first appearance: ``system:1`` is the first
voice heard among the others, ``mixed:2`` the second voice of an imported file. The microphone
channel is always the person recording ("Io") and gets no id. Names chosen by the person live
in ``Metadata.speakers``; without one a voice shows as "Altri 1" or "Voce 1".
