"""Key phrases of a call and a title suggested from them, without a language model.

A RAKE-style extractor (Rose et al., 2010; decisions 0020, 0022, 0023). The text is cut into
candidate phrases at words that cannot belong to a topic:

- closed classes: articles, prepositions, pronouns, conjunctions, auxiliaries and modals,
  numbers; the fillers of docs/conventions.md and the usual discourse markers;
- the most frequent words of the language (Zipf frequency 6 or more, over one in a thousand
  words: "cosa", "think", "because"), the frequency-based stop list RAKE itself suggests;
- in the language a word was said in, a lower bar (Zipf 5.4): the hedges of meeting speech
  ("kind", "things", "look"; "lavoro", "momento") sit between 5.4 and 6 in written frequency
  but are said constantly, so their TF beats any real topic;
- adverbs in -mente, punctuation, and doubtful words.

A phrase has one to three content words and may hold "di"/"of" ("raccolta delle olive", "number
of seeds"). It scores TF-IDF against the language: how often it is said, times how often its
words are said in the call weighted by how rare they are in Italian or English (wordfreq). So
"basil" or "DOP" beat "realtà" or "lavoro" without any list of generic words, also in calls
nobody looked at. Singular and plural count together.

The title is built like a title, not a tag list: the two best phrases joined by "e"/"and", and
two phrases with the same head coordinated ("peperoni rossi" + "peperoni gialli" -> "Peperoni
rossi e gialli").

A capital letter counts as a name only away from the start of a sentence, where the sentence
forces it. Whisper hallucinates "Thank you." on quiet stretches, one sentence per stretch, so
the capitalized "Thank" of a long call used to pass for a name and reach the title.

A doubtful word enters a phrase only if it was transcribed the same way at least
``DOUBTFUL_REPEATS`` times: once, it may be a mistake; ten identical "baking soda" are the subject
of the call. Nothing is added to the transcript; the title is only a suggestion the person can
change.
